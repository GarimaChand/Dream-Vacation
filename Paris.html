If you have never been to Paris and you are planning to go to Paris, here are some of the
cool and amazing places you can visit. One of the most important place to visit in Europe is Eiffel Tower 
in Paris. 
</p>
<p>
The Eiffel tower is located on the western side of the city. It is open every day of the 
year, fro 9a.m. to midnight from June 15 to September 1, and from 9:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. the rest of the year.
Before we get into further detail, lets learn some quick facts about the Eiffel Tower.
</p>
<p>
The Eiffel Tower was designed and constructed for 1889 Exposition Universelle( the World Fair).
It was almost universally hated by the French but it managed to skit demotion talks and since then
it has become of the well-known symbols. The Eiffel tower employs 300 workers, combines 18,038 pieces of
wrought iron. It is fastened with 2.5 million rivets, weighs 100,00 tons. It has the height of 984,25 ft.
The Eiffel tower is 6 inches taller in the summer because steel expands when warm. It was originally 
painted red.There are about 5 billion lights on the Eiffel tower.

<p>
The Eiffel tower in paris has  light show that runs for 5 minutes an hour, every night, until dawn.
The Eiffel tower is the most visited and tower in the world. I would really recommend 
visiting Eiffel Tower because it is one in a life time experience. You will not be sorry to
